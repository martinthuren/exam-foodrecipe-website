        <h1>Two guys with a big heart for amazing food</h1>
        <p>
          Hello everybody! Our names are Philip and Martin. We are two students
          who have launched this food recipe website.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are both passionate about fitness, health, and delicious food,
          which has always been a significant topic of discussion for us.
          Consequently, when we pursued studies in Computer Science, we aimed to
          create a website centered around these interests.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope you will enjoy our website and the recipes we have curated for
          you!
